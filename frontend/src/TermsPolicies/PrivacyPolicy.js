        information. The amount and type of information that BERLYWUD gathers
        depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors

        BERLYWUD discloses potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
        contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
        information in order to process it on BERLYWUD's behalf or to provide
        services available at BERLYWUD's website, and (ii) that have agreed not
        to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
        affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
        using BERLYWUD's website, you consent to the transfer of such
        information to them. BERLYWUD will not rent or sell potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
        Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
        as described above, BERLYWUD discloses potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in

        necessary to protect the property or rights of BERLYWUD, third parties
        or the public at large.

        primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we
        expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request
        (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
        we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or
        respond to your request or to help us support other users. BERLYWUD
        takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
